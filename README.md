# Building-permit-category-prediction-challenge
This hackathon challenge was organised by HackerEarth.

The aim of the challenge is to predict the type of permit requested for construction/demolition of a building. The building categories include Single family, Multi family, Commercial, Industrial and Edcational.

Based on different features like description about the building, its location, permit expiration date etc, we need to predict the building permit category. 

For detailed info, please refer PPT or python notebook where every step is clearly explained.

I have used the approach as shown by the Kaggle Grandmaster Abhishek Thakur. The Infographics are too good.
